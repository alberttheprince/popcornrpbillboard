# Hookah Palace - Billboard Template

A simple streamed asset resource for FiveM that serves as a template for replacing the three large billboards on the Hookah Palace buildings near Legion Square/MRPD area of downtown Los Santos.

Note: These are not premade images; you must edit them unless you love magenta, yellow, and cyan.

### Example:

## Features:
- Free PSD with included "weathered" textures and percentages: Just add your posters/images!
- Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta colour-coded/correctly positioned posters
- Premade image templates for all applicable LOD/visibility at distance


## Tips and Tricks:

This is a simple collection of assets, but I'll provide some tips so you can easily edit this:

- If you are new to this, you need codewalker or openIV to edit these files, remember you need to convert the png files to DDS (openIV and codewalker do this automatically I think) when replacing the textures inside the ytd
- To use the project/PSD file, you will need Photoshop. This isn't necessary to work on the PNGs (any image editor/creator will work), but will let you access the premade weathering patterns.
Pay attention to the placement of colours. In some cases, the colours switch positions. I'm not sure why, but this is how Rockstar has positioned them, and I've followed exactly how they placed the images. These are mainly in the distant LODs, so even if you mess this up people probably won't notice it.
- Work off the 2048 x 2048 image resolution, and resize down. The largest resolution in any of these files is 2048 x 2048
- All the images you need are in the project folder, edit, then replace the images with the same name inside of the ytd file
- If you experience any issues, your other MLOs may have similarly named files/use them. This shouldn't happen, but always check if you see anything weird
